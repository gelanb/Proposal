# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Scrapify

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A scraper that lets you collect tik tok's data after a user puts in a hashtag.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Scrapify will take the hashtag you input and store the videos linked with that specific hashtag and show it in a database that can easily be accessible. Scrapify will have features such as to order the data in a specific time frame, amount of likes, and getting multiple hashtags to use at the same time. A function I would hope to accomplish is to get multiple hashtags and order them based on a specific time frame and amount of like they have. Scrapify will be executed with python after inputting a hashtag you want to look up.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project is collecting all the data that is needed from the hashtag in an accessible form. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my project would be getting all the data that was collected and order with a specific amount of likes.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to to order the data with a specific amount of likes and in a specific time frame, combined with other hashtags.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn more about what an api is, selenium, and/or beautiful soup.
